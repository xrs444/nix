# Example additional configurations for external kanidm integration
# Since kanidm is hosted externally, you mainly need:

# 1. Update your external kanidm server URL in modules/services/kanidm/default.nix
# 2. Ensure your external kanidm has the required users:
#    - xrs444
#    - samantha  
#    - greyson
#    - rowan

# 3. Configure SSH key management in your external kanidm for these users
# 4. Optionally, you might want to store any SSH certificates or keys 
#    that your external kanidm issues, but this depends on your setup

# No additional secrets are typically needed in this nix config 
# since authentication is handled by the external kanidm server
